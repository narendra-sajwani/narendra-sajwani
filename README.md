- 👋 Hi, I’m Narendra Sajwani.
- 👀 I started exploring the Web3 and Blockchain technology about an year ago and got intrigued by the problems it can solve in a decentralized and trust-less manner. Excited by this powerful technology, I decided to learn more about this and transition full time as Full Stack Blockchain Developer. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about development of UI for interaction with the smart contracts deployed on Blockchain network.
- 💞️ I love brainstorming with fellow developers to solve complex problems and particularly how Blockchain can help in development of novel Web3 applications.
- 📫 Let's grab a coffee and collaborate on exciting problems being solved in Web3 space. Connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/narendrasajwani)
